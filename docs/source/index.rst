**VacHopPy** is a Python package for analyzing vacancy-mediated diffusion from molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations. The library facilitates a reliable **multiscale modeling** workflow by calculating key 
vacancy hopping parameters that can be directly incorporated into continuum-scale models.

Key Features
------------

* **Effective Parameter Extraction** 

  Derives a single set of effective hopping parameters from the MD simulations, 
  providing ready-to-use inputs for continuum-scale models.

* **Ensemble Analysis**

  Simultaneously processes an ensemble of multiple MD trajectories. 
  This approach efficiently samples rare hopping events in high-barrier systems, 
  avoiding the need for a single, prohibitively long simulation.

* **Memory-Efficient Processing**

  Reads and interprets large-scale trajectories via a streaming approach, 
  enabling the analysis of massive datasets within just a few gigabytes of RAM.

.. note::

   This package is designed for analyzing MD simulations performed under
   the **NVT (canonical) ensemble** with periodic boundary conditions (PBC).
